# 5_Project

## Overview
This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook for the **Final Project**. The project applies deep learning techniques to detect diseases in palm trees. The key aspects covered include:

- Problem definition and objective

- Data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Model selection, training, and evaluation

- Results interpretation and conclusions



## Executive Summary

This project focuses on **palm tree disease detection using deep learning**. Palm trees are susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact agricultural productivity. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of large-scale damage.

### **Methodology**
- The dataset consists of images of palm trees categorized as healthy or diseased.
- Preprocessing steps include image augmentation, resizing, and normalization.
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is employed for feature extraction and classification.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Key Findings**
- The deep learning model successfully identifies diseased palm trees with high accuracy.
- Data augmentation improves generalization and reduces overfitting.
- The trained model demonstrates robustness in detecting diseases under varying conditions.

### **Conclusion**
This study highlights the potential of deep learning for automated disease detection in palm trees. Future improvements may include integrating hyperspectral imaging and expanding the dataset for improved accuracy.
